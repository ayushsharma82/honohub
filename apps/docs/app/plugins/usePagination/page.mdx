# usePagination

Automatically add pagination to all collections in your HonoHub app. {{ className: 'lead' }}

It is a part of the `honohub` package, so you don't need to install any additional packages. This is useful when you have multiple collections in your app and don't want to add pagination to each collection manually.

If you want to have custom pagination for a specific collection, you can just add the `pagination` option to the collection configuration.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `usePagination` plugin -

```ts
import { usePagination } from "honohub/pagination";

export default defineHub({
  ...,
  plugins: [
    usePagination({
      defaultLimit: 10;
      maxLimit: 100;
    }),
  ],
});
```

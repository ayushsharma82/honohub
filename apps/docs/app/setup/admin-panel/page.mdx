# Admin Panel

The Admin Panel is a React application that provides a user interface to manage your HonoHub project. The Admin Panel is built using [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). But for using HonoHub, you don't need the dashboard. You can use the APIs directly, and use it as a headless CMS Solution or better create your own dashboard. But if you want to use the Admin Panel, here's how you can set it up. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Features

The Admin Panel provides the following features:

- **Dashboard**: View the status of your project, collections, and plugins.
- **Collections**: Manage your collections, schema, and APIs.
- **Plugins**: Interactive with your plugins and improve your experience.
- **Settings**: Manage your panel settings and configurations.

## Setting Up the Admin Panel

To set up the Admin Panel, you need to add the `@honohub/react` and `@honohub/vite` package to your project. You can do this by running the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
npm add @honohub/react @honohub/vite vite react react-dom
```

```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
yarn add @honohub/react @honohub/vite vite react react-dom
```

```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpm add @honohub/react @honohub/vite vite react react-dom
```

```bash {{ title: 'bun' }}
bun add @honohub/react @honohub/vite vite react react-dom
```

</CodeGroup>

After adding the packages, you need to create a new file named `vite.config.ts` in the root of your project and add the following configuration:

<CodeGroup title="vite.config.ts">

```ts
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import honohub from "@honohub/vite";
import hubConfig from "./hub.config";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    honohub({
      config: hubConfig, // Your hub configuration
      basePath: "/", // Base path for the admin panel
    }),
  ],
});
```

</CodeGroup>

You will also need to setup Tailwind CSS in your project. You can do this by following the [Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) for vite. This is the Tailwind CSS configuration for the Admin Panel:

<CodeGroup title="tailwind.config.js">

```js
const { join } = require("node:path");
const colors = require("tailwindcss/colors");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  darkMode: "class",
  content: [
    join(__dirname, "src/**/*!(*.stories|*.spec).{ts,tsx}"),
    "./node_modules/@rafty/**/*.js",
    "./node_modules/@honohub/react/**/*.js",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: colors.sky,
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [require("@rafty/plugin")],
};
```

</CodeGroup>

We are using `@rafty/ui` as our component lib. You can customize the Tailwind CSS configuration to match your project's design system. Follow the [Rafty UI documentation](https://rafty.rhinobase.io/) for more information.

Now add the following script to your `package.json` file:

<CodeGroup title="package.json">

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "vite:serve": "vite",
    "vite:build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

You can now start the Admin Panel using the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
npm run vite:serve
```

```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
yarn run vite:serve
```

```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpm run vite:serve
```

```bash {{ title: 'bun' }}
bun run vite:serve
```

</CodeGroup>

The Admin Panel will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. You can now start managing your HonoHub project using the Admin Panel.

## Customizing the Admin Panel

The Admin Panel can be customized using _plugins_. You can create custom plugins to add new features, modify existing features, or improve the user experience. You can also customize the Admin Panel's appearance using Tailwind CSS. Or you can add custom panels using `routes`.

Add a route in your `hub.config.ts` file:

```ts
const hubConfig = defineHub({
  // ...,
  routes: [
    {
      label: "Home",
      path: "/",
      import: "./src/pages/Home",
    },
  ],
});
```

Now your component in `src/pages/Home.tsx` file will be available at `/` path. You can add more routes to create custom pages in the Admin Panel.

And you are not limited to React. Just add the necessary configuration to the `vite.config.ts` file and either add the `routes` in the `hub.config.ts` or add the `generator` property in the `honohub` vite plugin. It's a vite app, so you can use any plugin that is compatible with Vite.

- Use a different frontend framework like Vue, Solid, or Svelte.
- Use a different CSS framework like Chakra, MUI, or Bulma.
- Add custom routes and panels to the Admin Panel.

Go crazy!

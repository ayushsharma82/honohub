# createHub

The `createHub` function returns a Hono App with all the default and user defined plugins and collections, generating the APIs. Here's an example of how to create a Hono App with the `createHub` function -

```ts
const hubConfig = {
  db,
  plugins: [useGraphQL()],
  collections: [todos],
};

const app = new Hono().route("/", createHub(hubConfig));
```

This will generate an app with Rest APIs and GraphQL endpoints for the `todos` collection. You can add more collections and plugins to the `hubConfig` object to generate more APIs and customize the app.

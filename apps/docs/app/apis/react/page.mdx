# @honohub/react

The `@honohub/react` package is built using React, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Rafty UI, React Query and other utility packages to render the Admin Panel. This package is a component library which can be used to render the Admin Panel in your React app. That means you can use the components from this package to build your own Admin Panel in your React or Nextjs app, while serving the APIs from your Hono App.

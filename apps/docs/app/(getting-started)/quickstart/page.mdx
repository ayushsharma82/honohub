# Quickstart

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up a new project with HonoHub, define your Drizzle schema, and generate API endpoints effortlessly. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Prerequisites

Before setting up HonoHub, ensure you have the following:

- A [Hono project](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/basic) set up for your preferred runtime.
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql-schema-declaration) configured in your project.

## Setting Up HonoHub

HonoHub is a _middleware_ that seamlessly integrates into your existing setup without imposing any restrictions on your setup or other middlewares. It provides flexibility, allowing you to customize and extend your application as needed.

### Install HonoHub

Add the `honohub` package to your project using your preferred package manager.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
npm add honohub
```

```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
yarn add honohub
```

```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpm add honohub
```

```bash {{ title: 'bun' }}
bun add honohub
```

</CodeGroup>

### Setting Up HonoHub

Create a new file named `honohub.config.ts` or `honohub.config.js` in the root of your project and add the following configuration:

<CodeGroup title="honohub.config.ts">

```ts
import { neon } from "@neondatabase/serverless";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/neon-http";
import { defineCollection, defineHub } from "honohub";
import * as schema from "./src/db/schema";

const neonSql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
const db = drizzle(neonSql, { schema });

export default defineHub({
  db,
  collections: [
    defineCollection({
      slug: "todos",
      schema: schema.todos,
    }),
  ],
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### Adding HonoHub in your Project

Add HonoHub to your Hono project like any other route:

<CodeGroup title="index.ts">

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { createHub } from "honohub";
import hubConfig from "../honohub.config";

const app = new Hono().route("/", createHub(hubConfig));
```

</CodeGroup>
